# cljs-noderepl

Provides a ClojureScript REPL running on Node.JS.

## Requirements

You must have Node version 0.8.x or higher installed.

## Leiningen Plugin

To setup the Leiningen plugin, add this to your `project.clj` or `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[org.bodil/lein-noderepl "0.1.5"]]
```

Then, start the REPL like this:

```bash
$ lein trampoline noderepl
```

## In-Project Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[org.bodil/cljs-noderepl "0.1.5"]
```

To launch the REPL the hard way, run `lein repl` and enter the following:

```clojure
(require '[cljs.repl :as repl] '[cljs.repl.node :as node])
(repl/repl (node/repl-env))
```

## Environment

The REPL is connected to a live Node process running a sandboxed
environment, which provides all of Node's available global variables.

As an example, here's the standard Node hello world, in REPL ready
ClojureScript:

```clojure
(let [http (js/require "http")
      handler (fn [req res] (.end res "Hello sailor!"))
      server (.createServer http handler)]
  (.listen server 1337))
```
## Readline Support

If you have rlwrap installed, the following provides basic readline and paren matching support:

```bash
rlwrap -r -m -q '\"' -b "(){}[],^%3@\";:'" lein trampoline noderepl
```
